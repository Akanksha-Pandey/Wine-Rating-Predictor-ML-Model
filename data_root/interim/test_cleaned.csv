France,"Steel and nervy mineralogy are the hallmarks of this wine at this stage. It's still waiting for the fruit to develop, but expect crisp citrus and succulent apples.

New Zealand,"This impressive operation covers much of eastern Waiheke, although only a small portion of the property is planted to vines. The 2010 vintage was especially good on the island, and this wine is crammed with ripe, peachy fruit, framed by smoky oak and roasted nuts.

Chile,"A perennial favorite due to its precise yet prickly nose of green melon, passion fruit, grapefruit and minerality. It's smooth yet cutting on the palate, with pithy lime, orange, passion fruit and lemon flavors. More refined than CDB's Gran Reserva, but generally speaking it's a similar wine.",91,33.0,Casablanca Valley,,Michael Schachner,Casas del Bosque 2011 Pequeñas Producciones Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Homer is the reserve cuvée, a barrel-selection seemingly chosen for a bit of extra concentration.

The winery suggests that it is their most ageworthy Pinot Noir, and the structure of this young wine would support that assertion. It's tight, hard, compact with black fruits, smoke and chewy tannins. It's a wine that needs time to stretch its considerable muscles.

That same aromatic zesty touch pervades the entire palate, perfuming the rich ripe pear fruit and providing a wonderfully bright firm structure. There is a warm energetic core to this wine and quite some warmth, but this is beautifully countered by the citrus freshness. Right now all the notions are primary and delicious but this will evolve and develop. The concentration certainly is there.
